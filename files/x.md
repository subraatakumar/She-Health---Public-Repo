# 🚀 Open Source Contribution: UI Development Inspired by Figma  

## 🎯 Project Overview  
I am contributing to an open-source project by developing a user interface inspired by a free Figma design. This is a self-imposed challenge to complete the UI within **10 hours** before next Saturday. My goal is to demonstrate my front-end skills, contribute meaningfully to open source, and build a strong portfolio to secure a **developer role**.  

## 🔥 Why This Contribution Matters  
- **Real-World Development Experience**: Working on an actual project rather than tutorials.  
- **Portfolio Enhancement**: Showcasing a fully implemented UI to attract recruiters.  
- **Collaboration & Open Source Exposure**: Engaging with the community and understanding the workflow.  
- **Time Management & Productivity**: Delivering results within a strict timeframe.  

## 📌 Key Considerations for UI Development  
- **Pixel-Perfect Implementation**: Ensuring the UI matches the Figma design.  
- **Responsiveness**: Making sure the UI works seamlessly across devices.  
- **Code Quality**: Writing clean, reusable, and maintainable code following best practices.  
- **Accessibility**: Ensuring that the UI is usable for all users, including those with disabilities.  
- **Performance Optimization**: Avoiding unnecessary re-renders and optimizing assets.  
- **Version Control & Documentation**: Committing changes with meaningful messages and documenting the work.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools  
- **Framework/Library**: [React.js / React Native / Vue.js / Other]  
- **Styling**: CSS / TailwindCSS / Styled Components  
- **State Management**: Context API / Redux (if applicable)  
- **Development Tools**: GitHub, VS Code, ESLint, Prettier
