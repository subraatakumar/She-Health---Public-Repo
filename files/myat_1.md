# Contributing to Kind Connect: My Journey

## Introduction

Hi, myself Myat! I have decided to contribute to the open-source project **Kind Connect** to showcase my skills and talent to the world. Open source is a great way to collaborate with developers, gain real-world experience, and give back to the community.

## My Goal: User Profile Screen

I have set a clear goal for myself—to implement the **User Profile Screen** for the Kind Connect app. This screen will allow users to view and manage their profile information, ensuring a seamless and user-friendly experience. Additionally, I am grateful that Subrata sir will be reviewing my code, as his insights and feedback will help me refine my skills and grow into a better developer.

### Tech Stack
- **Framework:** React Native
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Backend:** Oracle Cloud (as per the project infrastructure)

## Why Kind Connect?
Kind Connect is a platform that brings kind-hearted people together for meaningful interactions like mentoring, donating, and listening. Contributing to this project aligns with my passion for building impactful applications that make a difference in people's lives.
